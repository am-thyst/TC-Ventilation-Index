# TC-Ventilation-Index
Calculate TC Ventilation Index using python.

**TC Ventilation Index** was proposed by Tang and Emanuel in [this 2012 paper.](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00165.1)<br>

From the expression of the ventilation index, we need to calculate **three parts**:<br>
>**Vertical Wind Shear**<br>

>**Entropy Deficit**<br>

>**Potential Intensity**<br>

Here, I calculate the three parts separately and save them as three .nc files, then put them together to get the ventilation index.
